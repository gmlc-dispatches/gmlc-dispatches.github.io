Value Proposition Deployment of integrated hybrid energy systems is expected to increase in coming years and no single platform exists for dynamic modeling of these systems as they interact with the bulk power system. Addresses 3 major challenges: Conceptual design of novel hybrid systems in a way that enables rigorous exploration of the design space Values the output of the hybrid system within the context of the grid and region it is deployed Detailed dynamic models coupled with nonlinear model predictive control based on market signals Project Objectives Open, transparent, multi-lab computational platform to support the design, optimization, and analysis of tightly coupled hybrid systems.
