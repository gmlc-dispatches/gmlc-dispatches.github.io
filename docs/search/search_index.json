Value Proposition Deployment of integrated hybrid energy systems is expected to increase in coming years and no single platform exists for dynamic modeling of these systems as they interact with the bulk power system. Addresses 3 major challenges: Conceptual design of novel hybrid systems in a way that enables rigorous exploration of the design space Values the output of the hybrid system within the context of the grid and region it is deployed Detailed dynamic models coupled with nonlinear model predictive control based on market signals Project Objectives Open, transparent, multi-lab computational platform to support the design, optimization, and analysis of tightly coupled hybrid systems. Demonstrate and quantify the benefits of potential hybrid systems based on 3 case studies: Coal (existing and Coal FIRST) with energy storage, etc. Existing nuclear with hydrogen production and utilization Renewables with dispatchable options (batteries, NGCC) Build on DOE investments in modeling and simulation capabilities to support a resilient, reliable, and cost-effective bulk power system.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#dispatches-home","text":"D esign I ntegration and S ynthesis P latform to A dvance T ightly C oupled H ybrid E nergy S ystems Part of the DOE Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium (GMLC)","title":"DISPATCHES Home"},{"location":"#project-description","text":"DISPATCHES, the Design Integration and Synthesis Platform to Advance Tightly Coupled Hybrid Energy Systems, will be developed and used to identify and optimize Integrated Energy Systems for operation within the bulk power system via energy market signals.","title":"Project Description"},{"location":"#value-proposition","text":"Deployment of integrated hybrid energy systems is expected to increase in coming years and no single platform exists for dynamic modeling of these systems as they interact with the bulk power system.
